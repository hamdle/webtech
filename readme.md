# wo app

This is a web application to track my workouts, herby dubbed wo.

There are three parts to the wo project (1) the app, (2) the API, and (3) the deploy.

This is (1) the app. The app is the front-end of wo. It displays and posts the workout data. 

The workout app posts to an API and is deployed by a custom-built auto deploy application.
