# Workout App

The Workout App is designed to track workouts that I've been doing for the past few years. There's an accompanying API that manages all of the user and exercise data that works in collaboration with the App. The App has been designed to help enter and track exercies during a workout as well as to send the data to the API to chart workouts over time.

# API submodule

The API, written in PHP, is located in the /api folder at the root of the application.

# Pages

### Login page

Located at '/', the login page authenticates the user and forwards them to the workout page.

### Workout page

Located at '/go', the workout page helps the user build a workout from existing exercies and then runs the workout for the user to do.
